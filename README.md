**A complete guide to creating, deploying, and improving your code components**

## What is this book about?

Power Apps Component Framework is used by professional developers to extend the capabilities
of model-driven and canvas apps. Extending Microsoft Power Apps with Power Apps Component
Framework will take you through the basic as well as advanced topics using practical examples.

The book starts by helping you understand the fundamentals of the framework, its lifecycle,
and the tools that you'll use to build code components using best practices and file management
guidelines. You'll then learn how to extend Power Apps step by step and apply the principles and concepts covered in the book to build code components for field type attributes. The book covers different ways of debugging code components and guides you through the process of building code components for datasets. You'll also explore the functions and methods provided by the framework to enhance your controls using powerful sets of libraries and extensions. As you advance, you'll get to grips with creating and managing authentication profiles, discover different ways of deploying code components, and configure code components in model-driven and canvas apps. Finally, you'll learn some of the important features of the framework and learn modern web development practices.

By the end of this Power Apps book, you'll be able to build, debug, enrich, and deploy code
components confidently.
